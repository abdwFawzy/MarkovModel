laughs when he is merry, so no one tires of his speaking; he 
only laughs when he is in mourning, will do. 2. Tzu-hsia said, 
Goodness, clutched too narrowly; a belief in the Way which is 
not honest; can they be moved? 23. Tzu-chang[21] asked whether 
we can know what is to be lord, might not this one saying almost 
wreck a kingdom? 16. The Duke of She told Confucius, Among the 
upright men of my clan if the father steals a sheep his son bears 
witness. Confucius answered, Our clan's uprightness is unlike 
that. The father screens his son and the son no son, though the 
grain were there, could I get anything to eat? 12. The Master 
said, I do not know what pruning they still need! 22. The Master 
said, Learning knows no rank. 39. The Master said, At sight of 
worth, think to grow like it; at sight of baseness, search thyself 
within. 18. The Master said, My two-three boys, why lament your 
fall? The Way has long been lost below heaven! Now Heaven shall 
make the Master into a warning bell. 25. The Master said, To 
be always courteous of eye and courteous of ear;

draw near to them, they get unruly; if we hold to main lines. 
24. The Master said, Sorrow not at being unknown; sorrow for 
thine own shortcomings. 33. The Master said, By one revolution 
Ch'i might grow to be Lu; by one revolution Lu might reach the 
Way. 23. The Master said, The young should be dutiful at home, 
modest abroad, careful and true, overflowing in kindness for 
all, but in brotherhood with love. And if they have strength 
to spare they should spend it on the arts. 7. Tzu-hsia[3] said, 
If a good man taught the people for seven years, they would be 
fit to bear arms too. 30. The Master said, Duke Huan gathered 
the great vassals round him, not by chariots of war, but through 
the might of Kuan Chung. What can love do more? What can love 
do more? What can love do more? 18. Tzu-kung said, When Duke 
Huan slew the young duke Chiu. _Huan T'ui_, vii. 22, an officer 
of Chou. _Chi-sun_, xiv. 38, or Chi (which see), probably Chi 
Huan, the head of the Meng clan, his piety. _Meng Kung-ch'o_ 
head of the Chi clan, in whose service Tzu-lu was.] The Master 
said,

Every wild tribe has its lord, whereas the lands of Hsia[24] 
have none! [Footnote 24: China.] 6. The Chi sacrificed to Mount 
T'ai.[25] [Footnote 25: A prerogative of the Duke of Chou; yet 
Ch'iu[99] became his tax-gatherer and made him still richer. 
[Footnote 95: Tzu-lu. This prophecy came true. Tzu-lu and Tzu-kao 
were officers of Wei when troubles arose. Tzu-lu hastened to 
the help of the Way, who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, 
it is idle talking to. [Footnote 36: _Shih:_ a gentleman entitled 
to bear arms, not a knight in armour.] 10. The Master said, Men 
are near to each other by nature; the lives they lead sunder 
them. 3. The Master said, Smooth words, fawning looks, and overdone 
humility, Tso Ch'iu-ming thought shameful, and so do I. 25. As 
Yen YÃ¼an and Chi-lu[47] were sitting with him, the Master said, 
What does the Book mean by saying that Kao-tsung[135] in his 
mourning shed did not speak for three years? Why pick out Kao-tsung? 
said the Master. It would be better if all the good men of the 
south have a saying, To be lord is hard and to be minister of. 
_Hsien_, xiv. 1: _see_
