# MarkovModel
EfficientMarkovWord is a Java program that generates random text using the Markov chain algorithm. It builds a hashmap to map WordGrams to a list of words that follow them, and generates text by randomly selecting words from this list. The program takes an integer value to represent the Markov model order.
